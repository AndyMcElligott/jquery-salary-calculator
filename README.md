# Project Name

Salary Calculator

## Description

Allows users to input employee information to quickly determine whether they are on budget. This application will take inputs for employee's first and last names, job title, employee ID, as well as their annual salary. Once inputted, their information will be displayed on the table below. From there, a salary computation will take place to calculate the monthly salary, and if over $20k, the salary will turn red.

# Installation

# Project Status
The monthly calculation needs some tweeks in order to get it to populate on the DOM correctly. Also had trouble getting the information to calculate on the monthly total.
